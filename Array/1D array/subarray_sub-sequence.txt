// concept of subarrays and subsequencs
//**************************************

//                  subarrays------> subarray is nothing but the continous part of an array.

//         eg. array --> 8 5 6 7 2 1 9 0
//             ---> subarrays = 8 , 9 , 7 2 1 , 9 0 , 5 6 7 and can be of any type but there is only one condition that they should continous.

//                  subsequence -----> there is only difference between subarray and subsequences that subsequences might not be continous but they should be ordered
//                         ---> subsequence = 6 9 0 , 5 1 9 and many more .


//                 no. of subarrays possible = n*(n+1)/2
//                 no. of subsequence posible = 2^n         where is n is no. of values present in an array.
